<h3><b><i> Hello!, Tere! , hallo! </i></b></h3>
I am currently a Graduate Student at University of Waterloo.  
Previously worked at Collaborative Robotics and Robotic Computing Group at University of Tartu , Estonia. Prior to that  I was working in <a href="https://robotics.iiit.ac.in//"> Robotics Research Center,(IIIT- Hyderabad )</a> working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/">Prof K. Madhava Krishna</a>. I received my Bachelors from the Indian Institute of Technology, Dhanbad, India, where Prof Mrinal Sen advised me.
My research pursuits encompass the expansive intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Control Theory, and Optimization as applied to Robotics. Presently, my research endeavors are concentrated on the development of algorithms tailored for Intelligent Control and planning purposes, specifically targeting Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous Vehicles.During leisure moments, I engage in playing first-person shooter video games and partake in hiking activities.
