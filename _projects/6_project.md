` THIS PROJECT IS A SMALL PART OF A RESEARCH PROJECT THAT I HAVE WORKED AT IIIT HYDERABAD,INDIA`
<a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">IIIT_HYD</a> website. <br/>

In This project I have modelled the hybrid VTOL in MATLAB ( which include modelling of dynamics and aerodynamic affects on VTOL) and verify its correctness and then calculated its TRIM points for fixed level flight through  MATLAB scripts.<br/>
A detailed description can be found in my bachelor's final year project pdf (chapter2) <br/>
